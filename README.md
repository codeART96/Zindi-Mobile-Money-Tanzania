# conclusion about use of financial services in Tanzania and the demographic factors associated with mobile money use?

Alot of mobile money users seem to be well established, educated persons. With high numbers of the users being married with families, have tertiary qualifications and land ownership. It was slightly strange to find that some didn't own phones or are officially with the service provider yet they are using their service from time to time. It's also clear they need to focus on keeping the service on a native language level becuase of educational reasons, and also brunching out to outside countries as alot of money was being exchanged across boarders probably because of spousal duties. Also there's market gap especially in the female sectors, land ownership and those who aren't getting salaries. Their customer base is also next to water so providing taliored specific services to them is an opportunity.
